[Deployed Application Link](https://cldominy.github.io/employee-directory/)

The employee directory is an application that allows users, such as a workplace, to search and sort through a database of employees by ultilizing React. By using React's library, the UI components are updated dynamically as a user types a last name into the search bar or clicks on a sort button. This way, as a company grows and gains more employees, it will be seamless to updated the employee's on the website as all the components are created with the intent of reusability.
